# How to Publish a Blog Post with Hugo + PaperMod

## 1. Create a New Post

Use Hugoâ€™s command:

```sh
hugo new posts/your-post-title.md
```

This creates `content/posts/your-post-title.md` with starter front matter.

---

## 2. Write Your Post

- Edit the new file in your editor.
- Write in Markdown.
- When ready to publish, set `draft = false` in the front matter.

**Example Post Template:**

```markdown
+++
title = "Your Post Title"
date = 2024-07-01T12:00:00Z
draft = false
tags = ["tag1", "tag2"]
+++
